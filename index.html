   <h2>A little biography</h2>
   <p>My name is Ruqayyah Sodiq, a Computer Science student at Ladoke Akintola University of Technology. I have always been passionate about upskilling and continuously expanding my knowledge. One of my key interests is working behind the scenes, which is why backend engineering appeals to me—it aligns perfectly with my preference for building and optimizing systems without being in the spotlight.</p>

   <p>I joined the School of Engineering program to deepen my understanding of backend development and refine my technical skills. For me, learning is a lifelong journey, and I firmly believe that nothing is truly difficult—what makes something hard is either a lack of belief in oneself or an unwillingness to put in the effort. Through this program, I aim to gain hands-on experience, connect with like-minded individuals, and equip myself with the skills needed to excel in the field of engineering.</p>
